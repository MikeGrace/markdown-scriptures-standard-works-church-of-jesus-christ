Files are written lowercase in an API like format for faster opening and linking (1nephi01)

Folders are numbered in order to enable using file navigation for sequential reading (01 1 Nephi, 02 2 Nephi, ...)
- An application like Obsidian can star a file and a reader can update that star as they read sequentially

Each verse has a H2 heading so they can be cross-referenced via Wikilinks in an application like Obsidian [[1nephi03#5]]

Blockquotes can be used to write comments directly after a verse by using the markdown > symbol  
- I left a few of my comments in 1 Nephi as an example 

Visual Studio Code's Find and Replace is an efficient way to change file content (verse headings, ect)

Write a script or use a name changing application like namechanger for the mac to change file names
