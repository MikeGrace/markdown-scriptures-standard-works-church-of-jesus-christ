Files are written lowercase with the chapter following for fast opening and linking (1nephi1)

Folders are numbered in order to enable using file navigation for sequential reading (01 1 Nephi, 02 2 Nephi, ...)
- An application like Obsidian can star a file and a reader can update that star as they read sequentially

Each verse has a H2 heading so they can be cross-referenced via Wikilinks in an application like Obsidian [[1Nephi3#7]]

Multiple verses can be referenced by referencing a chapter and noting the verses [[1Nephi3]]:7-9

Bullets (-) or Blockquotes (>) can be used to write comments directly after a verse

You might consider writing comments that apply only to a particular verse directly after that verse, and comments that could be applied to mulitple verses (principles) as a separate note that is referenced (linked to) from the scripture

Visual Studio Code's Find and Replace is an efficient way to change file content (verse headings, ect)

A name changing application like namechanger for mac works well to change file names
