Files are written lowercase in an API like format for faster opening and linking. Example: 1nephi.01

Folders are numbered in order so one could use file navigation to read sequentially 
- The Application like Obsidian can star a file and a reader can update that star as they read requentially

Each verse has a H2 heading so they can be cross-referenced via Wikilinks in an application like Obsidian. Example: [[1nephi.03#5]]

Blockquotes could be used to write comments directly after a verse by using the markdown > symbol  
- I left a few of my comments in 1 Nephi as an example
